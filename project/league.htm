        <h1>Review: League of Legends</h1>
        <p>League of Legends is a free multiplayer game in which two teams of five players use abilities and attacks to kill each other and take down each other's bases. 
            One of the great things about this game is that the more you play it, the better it gets. <img src="lol.jpg" alt="League of Legends Image" title="League of Legends Poster" width="300px"></p>
        <p>Overview: <b>10.0/10</b>. This game is a great play, but is best if you're willing to spend a lot of hours on it. It has a great value considering it is free to play with optional purchase. 
            It is available for free at <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/">leagueoflegends.com</a>. I would recommend.</p>
