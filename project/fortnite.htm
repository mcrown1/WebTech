        <h1>Review: Fortnite</h1>

        <p>Overview: <b>7.5/10</b>. Fortnite has become a cultural phenomenon with its unique ability to be played across many devices and appeal to younger audiences.
            Although I did not personally enjoy the game due to its genre and building system, the dances, graphics, and violence are what make it 
            so appealing to younger kids. The fact that this game is free and available on almost any device is a very good tactic by Epic Games to allow literally anyone with an interest to play this game.
            I would recommend trying it at least once just to see what the hype is about.
