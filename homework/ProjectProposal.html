        <p>This website is dedicated to rating and reviewing different video games.
            The goal of this website is to provide helpful reviews to people 
            when deciding if they want to buy or download a video game or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The target audience for this content would be gamers, who typically are kids and young adults and skew male.
            There will be a homepage, a page for contacting me, a navigation page, and pages on at least 4 video games that includes reviews of their quality and price.
            The current plan for the games I will review is Stardew Valley, Skyrim, Fortnite, and League of Legends.
