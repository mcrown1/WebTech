        <h3>Subject: Video Game Reviews</h3>
        <hr>        
        <p>This website is dedicated to rating and reviewing different video games.
            The goal of this website is to provide helpful reviews to people 
            when deciding if they want to buy or download a video game or not.
            Each game will get a summary of what I like and dislike about it and 
            may end with a recommendation to download or buy the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The target audience for this content would be gamers. The kinds of people who play different games varies greatly depending on the game.
            The games I plan on reviewing are very different from each other but still 
            This group is typically kids and young adults and skews male.
            <br>
            There will be a homepage, a page for contacting me, a navigation page, and pages on at least 4 video games that includes reviews of their quality and price.
            The current plan for the games I will review is Stardew Valley, Skyrim, Fortnite, and League of Legends, but this list may be expanded.
